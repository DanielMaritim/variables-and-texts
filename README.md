Its called concantenation...so what is it and how is it important?

In javascript the "+" operator is used to add numbers or to concatenate strings. if one of the operands is a string "+" concatenates, and if it is only numbers it adds them. This can happen because java script allows white spaces sometimes if a string is concatenated with a number.

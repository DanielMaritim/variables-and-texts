This is a simple repo about joining variables and texts

Its called concantenation...so what is it and how is it important?

Concatenation is the operation of joining two strings together. The term"concatenation" literally means to merge two things together

The concat() method is used to join two or more strings. This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a new string containing the text of the joined strings

The same + operator you use for adding two numbers can be used to concatenate two strings. You can also use += , where a += b is a shorthand for a = a + b . If the left hand side of the + operator is a string, JavaScript will coerce the right hand side to a string

In javascript the "+" operator is used to add numbers or to concatenate strings. if one of the operands is a string "+" concatenates, and if it is only numbers it adds them. This can happen because java script allows white spaces sometimes if a string is concatenated with a number.

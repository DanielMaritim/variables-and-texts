Its called concantenation...so what is it and how is it important?

Concatenation is the operation of joining two strings together. The term"concatenation" literally means to merge two things together


In javascript the "+" operator is used to add numbers or to concatenate strings. if one of the operands is a string "+" concatenates, and if it is only numbers it adds them. This can happen because java script allows white spaces sometimes if a string is concatenated with a number.
